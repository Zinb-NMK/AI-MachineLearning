📊 Data Processing for Machine Learning
This folder contains essential scripts and resources for preprocessing data in Machine Learning projects. Key concepts include encoding categorical data, feature scaling, and managing datasets.

🚀 Key Concepts
1. Encoding Categorical Data
Converts categorical variables into numerical values to enable machine learning algorithms to process them.
Techniques:
Label Encoding: Assigns a unique integer to each category.
One-Hot Encoding: Converts categories into binary vectors.

2. Feature Scaling
Normalizes data to ensure all features contribute equally.
Techniques:
Min-Max Scaling: Rescales data between 0 and 1.
Standardization: Centers data around the mean with unit variance.

3. Loading and Updating Datasets
Loading Data: Uses pandas to read datasets from various file formats.
Updating Data: Cleaning, filtering, or adding new records.

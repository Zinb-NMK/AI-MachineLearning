📊 Machine Learning Project README
Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms repository! This project explores four key algorithms: 
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Multiple Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

🚀 Algorithms Overview
1. Linear Regression
Goal: Predicts continuous outcomes (e.g., salary prediction based on experience).
Key Steps: Data splitting, model training, prediction, and visualization.
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

2. Logistic Regression
Goal: Predicts binary outcomes (e.g., classification of social network ads).
Key Steps: Feature scaling, model training, prediction, evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

3. Multiple Regression
Goal: Predicts continuous outcomes with multiple features (e.g., company profit based on various inputs).
Key Steps: Categorical encoding, model creation, and performance evaluation.
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn.

4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Goal: Classifies data into categories using hyperplanes.
Key Steps: Feature scaling, model training, prediction, confusion matrix, and accuracy calculation.
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

📂 How to Run:
   1. Install dependencies:
      <pre><b>         pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib<b></pre>

   2. Load your dataset: Ensure CSV files are available in your working directory.
   3. Execute the script: Run the desired algorithm’s Python file.

📊 K-Means Clustering Project
This project demonstrates how to implement K-Means clustering on a customer segmentation dataset, utilizing Python's scikit-learn and matplotlib.

🚀 Overview
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data into clusters based on similarity. 
In this project:
-> We cluster customers based on their annual income and spending score.
-> The elbow method helps determine the optimal number of clusters.

📁 Dataset
Name: Mall_Customers.csv
